    question: "How soon can we expect to see a measurable return on our investment?",
    answer: "Most clients begin seeing measurable ROI within 3 to 6 months of deployment. By accelerating coding throughput, reducing denial rates, and improving risk capture, our AI quickly drives both cost savings and revenue lift. Many organizations also see immediate benefits in backlog clearance and faster claim submission cycles."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure the accuracy of the AI's coding suggestions?",
    answer: "Our platform is built with a hybrid approach that combines advanced natural language processing with clinical knowledge models. Each code is generated with confidence scoring, routed to human review when necessary, and continuously validated against audited results. This ensures consistently high accuracy levels, with many deployments achieving 98% coding precision."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI stay updated with the latest coding regulations and guidelines?",
    answer: "The system is continuously trained and updated with the latest ICD, CPT, HCPCS, and payer-specific guidelines. Our compliance team works closely with coders and regulatory experts to integrate rule changes in real time, ensuring that every claim aligns with current requirements. This proactive updating helps clients stay compliant, reduce audit risks, and capture full reimbursement."
